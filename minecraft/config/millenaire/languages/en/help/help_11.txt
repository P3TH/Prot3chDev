<darkblue>The Japanese

They live in religious, military or imperial villages, and are distinguished by their elegant architecture. They speak Japanese, but their dialogue will be translated as the player "learns" their language by speaking with them.

-Like the Normans, they produce timbered buildings.
-They use a lot of thatch blocks manufactured from wheat.
